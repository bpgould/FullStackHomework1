This is an example of a basic HTML webpage that is styled with css.

For this assignment I refactored the code in order to delete superfluous classes, convert single-use classes to ids, and simplify the folder structure. 

Other enhancements were made such as adding the css reset file and uploading the content to a GitHub page.
